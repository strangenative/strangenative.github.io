Expanded Facebook's search capabilities to include keyword search over trillions of posts with a privacy-aware index.

Instead of relying on natural language queries like Graph Search, Post Search focuses on keyword-based queries that users can filter by date, location, and other parameters. This feature aims to improve content discovery, making it easier for users to find and engage with relevant content on the platform.

Key Features and Advantages

Enhanced Content Discovery: Post Search allows users to find relevant content based on their interests and connections. By searching for specific keywords, users can quickly discover public posts, as well as posts from friends, that contain the desired information.
Improved Search Results: Post Search utilizes Facebook's vast user-generated content database to deliver more accurate and diverse search results. It combines the power of keyword-based search with Facebook's social graph data to offer personalized search results.
Real-Time Information: Post Search enables users to find real-time information about events, news, and trending topics by searching for relevant keywords. This feature helps users stay informed and connected to the latest happenings around the world.
Privacy Settings: Facebook's Post Search respects users' privacy settings. Only public posts and posts from friends that match the user's search query will be displayed in the search results, ensuring that private content remains protected.
Comparison to Graph Search

While both Graph Search and Post Search aimed to improve content discovery on Facebook, they differed in their approaches. Graph Search focused on natural language queries and utilized social connections to provide personalized results. However, it faced challenges related to privacy concerns and limited natural language processing capabilities.

On the other hand, Post Search focuses on keyword-based queries and offers a more traditional search experience. By simplifying the search process and integrating personalization features, Post Search provides an effective and user-friendly way to discover content on Facebook.

Conclusion

Facebook's Post Search marks a new chapter in social media search by offering an improved and personalized search experience. By combining keyword-based search with the power of Facebook's social graph data, Post Search enables users to discover relevant content and stay connected to their interests and friends. As the platform continues to evolve, it's likely that Facebook will further refine and expand its search capabilities to enhance the user experience and strengthen its position in the world of social media.
