When <a href="https://www.jessicahische.is">Jessica Hische</a> and I first started dating, I taught her some basic <small>HTML</small> and <small>CSS</small>. These skills were so empowering to her as a graphic designer trying to manage her presence online that we decided to embark on a project to help more creatives and other non-engineers gain web fundamentals so they could build their dreams on the internet too. 

[Don't Fear the Internet](http://www.dontfeartheinternet.com) was born‚Äîa series of video tutorials where we break down web development concepts into easily digestible lessons, coining amusing terms like ‚ÄúHamburger Text Markup Language‚Äù along the way. We cover the very basics of what the web is and introduce viewers to markup, responsive design, typography, and more.

Shortly after it launched in 2011 it was receiving tens of thousands of hits a day with more than half a million video views to date.

    ‚Äú&hairsp;Will be recommending this to every single person asking me how to get started into <small>HTML</small> and <small>CSS</small>.‚Äù<br>

_Don't Fear the Internet_ empowered non-web designers and creative individuals to gain a solid understanding of the foundations of web design and development. By demystifying the process and encouraging hands-on learning, we helped hundreds of thousands of folks develop the fundamentals needed to create and maintain their websites effectively. 

We've heard amazing stories from folks who benefitted from Don't Fear the Internet. We've even heard rumors it was being taught in classes at Stanford! üò≥
