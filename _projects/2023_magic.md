Merchants set a high bar for what goes live on their storefront. For Magic to succeed it needed to generate product descriptions they would love.

Early tests proved we'd have to push GPT beyond the repetitive tropes it had learned from broad sampling. We had to apply our domain expertise on product descriptions through prompt engineering.

As product lead, I helped define some keys tools and processes that would make it possible for our product description experts to become our prompt engineers. With these prompt exploration and evaluation tools in hand, they were able to rapidly iterate toward prompts that consistently produced descriptions that met our bar.

When generating descriptions or editing existing text merchants can pick from a short list of commerce-tested tones of voice, such as _expert_, _playful_, and _supportive_, and always have the option to edit the generated text before publishing to ensure a perfect match with their brand voice.

Shipped at <a href="https://www.shopify.com/editions/winter2023" target="_blank">Winter Editions 2023</a>, AI-Generated Product Descriptions are now out to 100% of merchants in supported languages.
