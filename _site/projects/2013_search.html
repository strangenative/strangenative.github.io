      <h1>Facebook Search</h1>
      <h2>Design Lead · 2012–2017</h2>
      <p>Worked directly with Mark on Facebook’s ground-breaking experiment, Graph Search, then led its evolution with a team I built from the ground up.</p>

<p>When I joined the design team at Facebook in 2011, users could only search for pages by name. It was the fastest way to navigate the massive platform, but Facebook wasn’t just a network of documents like the web. For its 1 billion daily active users, it had become a rich graph of connections reflecting their world.</p>

<p><code>
Example Graph Connections…<br /><br />
[User] — friendWith —▶︎ [User]<br />
[User] — likes ——————▶︎ [Page]<br />
[User] — taggedIn ———▶︎ [Photo]
</code></p>

<p>On January 15th, 2013 Facebook invited the press to an event at their new headquarters in Menlo Park. The presentation hall was packed with reporters snapping photos and live-blogging the opening moments.</p>

<p>The lights dimmed and a video played…</p>

<div class="video_wrap_16-9">

<p>When the lights came back on, Mark stood at the podium and announced Graph Search. A new type of search engine that used structured queries and natural language processing <small>(NLP)</small> to help users traverse their graph connections to discover new music, a fellow adventurer, or just all the photos they’ve liked.</p>

<h3>Key Features</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Search your social connections with structured queries.</li>
  <li>Result snippets explain each result’s relevance to you.</li>
  <li>Smart suggestions help you disambiguate your search query.</li>
  <li>Tailored page layouts for each result type.</li>
</ol>

<p>With firsts like a privacy-aware index, <small>NLP</small> parsing engine, as well as personalized autocompletions and search snippets, it was one of the most technically ambitious projects the young company had yet undertaken.</p>

<p>As Product Designer, I began working directly with Mark and other key executives in March of 2012. Mark called Search Facebook’s <em>Third Pillar</em>—as important to the company’s future as News Feed and Timeline. I took it from concept to launch in nine months, generating seven patents along the way.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Despite its innovative approach, adoption was low. Even the most advanced <small>NLP</small> of the day couldn’t handle user input outside of a recognized set. This put the burden on users to remember specific phrasings or else face frustration. In practice, users clearly preferred the simplicity of keywords to structured queries.</p>

<p>As we learned these hard lessons, we were simultaneously working to massively expand search’s capabilities. Every day in News Feed, billions of important posts would disappear beneath a continual stream of fresh content. Facebook offered no way for users to search for the most important posts they remembered seeing.</p>

<small class="media_description">Post Search, 2014</small></p>

<p>Indexing trillions of posts in a privacy aware index was an incredible infra challenge, but the functionality provided the perfect opportunity to transition Facebook search away from structured grammar to a simpler keyword model.</p>

<p>As Design Lead, I grew the team to 11 exceptional product designers and built strong partnerships with <small>UX</small> research to drive the design philosophy and align on a new direction for Facebook search.</p>

<p>Through exhaustive testing and iteration, the team balanced navigational and keyword intent in a simple typeahead experience that helped searchers get what they wanted fast without having to think about it.</p>

<p>The new result design system made it possible to flexibly rank top results for each type in a single view. For more challenging searches, tabs across the top filter results to a particular type.</p>

<p>The result of these efforts was a remarkably simplified and predictable search experience that still performs well years on. I’m proud of where we landed, but I do enjoy coming back from time to time to see if Graph Search support is still there, silently running beneath the hood. Last I checked, “My friends who live in [city]” still worked.</p>
